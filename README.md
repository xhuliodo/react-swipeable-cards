# React-Swipeable-Cards

React-swipeable-cards is a flexible react component that lets you build custom interactive cards that can be swipeable.

## Differences between the orignal package

This fork is the same as the original but a swipeSensitivity prop has been added. If not provided the value will be 300. (Decided to do this because the default value was not very mobile friendly)

Original Package: https://github.com/ravelinx22/react-swipeable-cards
